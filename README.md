# firebase-dots-game
This is an IONIC-3 and Firebase project.

This is a game which I used to play in school days, where we used to keep dots in square shape. Each user can connect the dots with a line in alternative turns. the one who completes a square gets 1 point, in the end the one who scores the highest is the winner.


Note: Use your own google firebase key, since the one which i have used in the project might be expired.
